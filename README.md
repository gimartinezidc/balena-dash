**Starter project setting up a Raspberry Pi and compatible display to show webpages, dashboards, data visualization, and more.**
 
# Highlights
 
- **Lightweight display of data or dashboards**: Use our lightweight web browser to display key metrics, public data sources, and dashboards to a compatible display or touchscreen.
- **Make your dashboard content available anywhere**: Access this content using secure public URLs.
- **Compatible with other automation tools**: Integrate balenaDash with home automation tools, e.g. Home Assistant to use as a dashboard.

# Motivation
 
![](https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2019/04/top_image.jpg)
 
balenaDash is a Raspberry Pi [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud/) starter project that lets you set up a web frame to display family photos, dashboards, videos, social media feeds, and more.
 
We want to create a project that motivates users to build their own customizable web frame to show webpages, dashboards, and other data visualization using a display and a single-board device. Use this project to solve for practical challenges around the home or office, or to even monitor data or deliver a live video feed in a production environment.
 
Contributors are welcome to improve this software and help one another get the most out of this project.
