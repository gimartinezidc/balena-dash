## What hardware do I need?

We’ve partnered with our friends at PiSupply to make it easy for you to get ahold of all the hardware you need to build this project in a single package. We’ve created two packages, one that includes everything you’ll need, and a second that includes everything apart from the display if you’ve already got a monitor you want to use.

- [balenaDash kit](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/balenadash-kit)
- [balenaDash kit - barebones](https://uk.pi-supply.com/products/balenadash-kit-barebones)

The list of items you’ll need is also included below:

- Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ (Note: this project will not work with Pi Zero or older devices with < 1GB RAM)
- 16GB Micro-SD Card (we recommend Sandisk Extreme Pro SD cards)
- Display (any Raspberry Pi display will work for this project)
- Micro-USB cable
- Power supply
- Case (optional)

## Can you use this balenaDash without the Raspberry Pi display?

Sure! Any HDMI display will work just as well.

## Why did you all extract the Photo Gallery service?

We want our projects to focus on one main use case and do them very well. We felt that balenaDash was a bit cluttered in trying to be both a data visualization, signage/webpage, and photo gallery all at once.

There's a lot of value in the photo gallery for our users, so we didn't just ditch it. You can find the photo gallery project [in its own repo here](https://github.com/balenalabs-incubator/photo-slideshow).
